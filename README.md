## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the mini course **Selenium WebDriver with Python: Fundamentals** offered by **BlazeMeter University**.  
The goal was to practice designing and running automated tests using **Selenium WebDriver with Python**, covering everything from local execution to applying best practices like the **Page Object Model (POM)**.

This project is intended purely for training purposes, so no real bugs are expected to be found or reported.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create and run automated tests in the **Chrome** browser.  
- Practice debugging tests using **PyCharm**.  
- Implement the **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture.  
- Get familiar with **Selenium Grid**, **Remote WebDriver**, and parallel execution.

---

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Selenium WebDriver**  
- **pytest**  
- **ChromeDriver**  
- **WebDriver Manager**  
- **Page Object Model (POM)**

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celiapaivab/python-selenium-project.git
```

2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4️⃣ Run the tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 🧾 Results

- Automated login tests.  
- Validation of elements on the home page.  
- Local execution in **Chrome**.  
- Well-structured project following the **Page Object Model (POM)**.


---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Installed **Selenium WebDriver** from scratch.  
- Created and executed tests in **Chrome**.  
- Debugged tests using **PyCharm**.  
- Organized tests following the **Page Object Model (POM)**.

---

## 💡 Melhorias Futuras

- Implement and validate **BlazeMeter integration** for remote and parallel execution.  
- Add more test scenarios.  
- Include automated HTML test reports.  
- Integrate tests with **CI/CD** pipelines.
